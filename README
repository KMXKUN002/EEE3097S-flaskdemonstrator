The demonstrator uses Python Flask to make an interactive HTML page.

Features
--------

Methods:
    gen(DroneCamera camera) -- A generator function to continually return 
        the frame() buffer from the DroneCamera class.
    
    video_feed() -- Retrieves individual frames from the frame buffer.

    zoom() -- Either sets or gets the zoom level.

    capture() -- Redirects user to where they may download a snapshot.
        The name of the image is determined by the coordinates.

    capture_with_filename() -- Downloads snapshot image.

To reuse this application for other interfaces than flask, replicate the generator function as used in the code.
Use the API's frame() to get individual frames from the frames buffer.
